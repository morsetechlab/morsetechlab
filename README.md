# üñê Hi, I‚Äôm Morse

I‚Äôm deeply passionate about **Computer Vision** ‚Äî from classical **Machine Learning** and **Stereo Vision** to modern **Deep Learning** and **Vision Transformers**.  
Currently on a lifelong journey of learning and building real-world AI systems.

My interest in CV started during my Master's thesis, where I explored:

> ü•¨ [Fresh Weight Estimation of Lettuce Using 3D Stereoscopic Technique](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10147436)  
> Presented at the **2023 8th International Conference on Business and Industrial Research (ICBIR)**

This project introduced me to **Stereo Vision**, **Cross-Correlation**, and **Linear Regression**, which became the foundation of my AI journey.

## What I'm working on
- Real-time projects in **Face Recognition**, **ALPR**, and **Object Detection** for practical applications
- Deploying AI models to both edge devices (Jetson Nano, Raspberry Pi) and scalable cloud backends

## Tech Stack
`Python` | `FastAPI` | `Next.js` | `Supabase`  
`OpenCV` | `YOLO` | `PaddleOCR` | `PyTorch` | `ONNX`

## Always learning
I'm currently diving deeper into:
- **Vision Transformers**
- **Model Optimization for Edge Deployment**
- **Multi-modal Learning**
